# Frontend for dracor.org

The web app running the [dracor.org](https://dracor.org) website.

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See its
[documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) on how to perform common tasks.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Note:** The app expects a local eXist database with the
[dracor-exist](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-exist) app installed to be
available at [http://localhost:8383](http://localhost:8383).

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the documentation about [running tests](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
